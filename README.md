The files located in this repository are:

1. Current projects completed in Tim Buchalka's Java Master Class on Udemy
   and are referenced with the exact name as those projects.

2. Additional projects that I completed to help strengthen my Java skills. 
   These projects did not come from the course but either through youtube videos, 
   stackoverflow.com, or some other source. 

3. For all projects, you may see commented out code. These comments will 
   have to be removed or uncommented in order for code to run locally. 

   Ex. //This is a comment

   All code are variations of the original project and work.

4. The IDE used was IntilliJIdea Community 2019.3. 

5. The solutions are "my solutions." While there are many different 
   ways to solve a programming problem, I try to find the way that works
   best for me. Sometimes this may be a longer route to solving the problem, 
   sometimes it may be shorter. Feedback is always welcome.
     
6. The files (Classes) are listed in alphabetical order, not chronological.
