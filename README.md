The files located in this repository are:

1. Current projects completed in Tim Buchalka's Java Master Class on Udemy
   and are referenced with the exact name as those projects.

2. Additional projects that I completed to help strengthen my Java skills. 
   These projects did not come from the course but either through youtube videos, 
   stackoverflow.com, or some other source. 

3. For all projects, you may see commented out code. 

   Ex. //This is a comment

   All code are variations of the original project and work.
