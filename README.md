The files located in this repository are:

1. Current projects completed in Tim Buchalka's Java Master Class on Udemy
   are referenced with the exact name as those projects.

2. Additional projects that I completed to help strengthen my Java skills. 
   These projects did not come from the course but either through YouTube videos, 
   stackoverflow.com, or some other source. 

3. For all projects, you may see commented out code. These comments will 
   have to be removed or uncommented in order for code to run locally. 

   Ex. //This is a comment

   All code is variations of the original project and work.

4. The IDE used was IntelliJIdea Community 2019.3. 

5. The solutions are "my solutions." While there are many different 
   ways to solve a programming problem, I try to find the way that works
   best for me. Sometimes this may be a longer route to solving the problem, 
   sometimes it may be shorter. Feedback is always welcome.
   
   Ex. At this point in my java learning, I prefer sum =  sum + i versus 
   sum += i; You may prefer sum += i, so use whatever form you are comfortable 
   with...that's programming.
     
6. The files (Classes) are listed in alphabetical order, not chronological.

7. You will notice that the for some Classes the main method is missing. That is because in 
   the exercises part of the instructions is to not include one. I did however include 
   the main method in some of the Classes, but if the code is pasted into an IDE as is it will not run
   unless a project is created with a command line app to include a main method. 

8. I have included several star pattern exercises named StarPatternX.java. The only problem relative 
   to the course is the DiagonalStar.java. The other ones are exercises that I found searching YouTube. 
   If you are having a difficult time wrapping your head around these types of problems then I would suggest
   practice practice practice. One thing that helped me very much understand this type of 
   logic was the Step by Step debugging option that is available with IntelliJ. 
   
   According to Jetbrains, the creator of IntelliJ, during a debugging session, you launch your program with 
   the debugger attached to it. The purpose of the debugger is to interfere with the program 
   execution and provide you with the information on whatâ€™s happening under the hood. This facilitates 
   the process of detecting and fixing bugs in your program.  You can actually execute each line by line 
   in your code and see how your code is affected by changes. A good link to understanding the debugging
   process is https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/debugging-your-first-java-application.html.
   
   
   For each of the additional star pattern exercises copy and paste the code in to your IDE and 
   see the pattern obtained. Then, comment out the code and click enter until you can't see the code 
   and try to recreate the pattern without looking at the completed code. I do plan on uploading 
   many more pattern type exercises in the future.
